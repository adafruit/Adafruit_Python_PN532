DEPRECATED LIBRARY. Adafruit Python PN532
=========================================

This library has been deprecated! We are leaving this up for historical and research purposes but archiving the repository.

We are now only supporting the use of our CircuitPython libraries for use with Python.

Please check out the Adafruit CircuitPython PN532 library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PN532

Adafruit Python PN532

Python library for accessing a PN532 NFC breakout over a SPI connection from a Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, etc.

Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit PN532 breakout using a SPI connection ----> https://www.adafruit.com/product/364

Installation
------------

To install the library make sure your device is connected to the internet (with a wired or wireless connection), then
connect to the device's terminal and run the following commands (assuming a Debian-based operating system like
Raspbian, Debian, Ubuntu, etc.):

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev git
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_PN532.git
cd Adafruit_Python_PN532
sudo python setup.py install
```

Look inside the examples directory for a simple example of detecting and reading a MiFare classic card with readmifare.py.
Make sure to run examples as root using sudo, for example:

```
sudo python readmifare.py
```
